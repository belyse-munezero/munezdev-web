    <h1>hospital rule</h1>
    <p>Hospital workflows are meticulously designed to ensure efficient and effective patient care.
         The process typically <br>begins with patient intake at the reception desk,<br>
         where basic information and initial symptoms are recorded. <br>
        From there, patients may <br>undergo triage in the emergency department or<br>
         proceed to scheduled appointments in various departments. In emergency situations, <br>
         critical patients are prioritized based<br> on the severity of their condition, ensuring timely medical attention.<br>
